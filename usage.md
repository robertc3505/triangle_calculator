Usage

1. Run code in your preferred IDE
2. Input 3 sides of triangle (Note negative or "0" values are not accepted)
3. Success! If the triangle is possible, then you know what type it is. 

Note: If triangle is not possible due to the Triangle Inequality Theorem, just run the program again with different measurments.

Good Luck!
